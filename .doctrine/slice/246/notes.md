# Notes SL-246: Entity reads carry their knowledge records

Durable per-slice scratchpad — tracked in git. The place to lift anything from a
disposable phase sheet (`.doctrine/state/.../phase-NN.md`) that must survive
`rm -rf` before the slice close-out audit harvests it.

## Design surface triage (2026-08-05, `exploring`)

Discharges `explore.triage`. The scope doc (`slice-246.md`) already carries the
open questions, risks, assumptions and governing context; this records only what
the exploration pass *added* to them.

### Prior art the design must ride, not re-invent

- **An entity `show` already renders a derived inbound axis.** `backlog show`
  surfaces `fulfilled by` via `derive_fulfils_inbound` (`src/backlog.rs:1368`,
  SL-176 PHASE-03) — full corpus scan → `build_relation_graph_from` → `in_edges`
  on a single label overlay → sorted canonical refs. SL-246's composed read is
  that shape generalised over a label *set*. This is the strongest DRY seam in
  the slice and it was not in the research artefact.
- **Cost note on that seam.** It scans the whole corpus per `show` invocation.
  Acceptable for one label on one item; the composed read must not multiply it.
- **`Detail::{Normal, Full}`** (`src/design_run/render/envelope.rs:86-117`) is
  the verbosity precedent — levels as caps on one code path. Already in the
  scope doc's design inputs.

### Constraints the exploration surfaced

- **`CatalogEntity` deliberately does *not* carry facets.** `estimate`/`value`
  were **deleted** from it at SL-222 PHASE-09, and `src/catalog/scan.rs:270`
  now runs a key-presence tripwire against their residue
  (`src/catalog/hydrate.rs:107`). `OQ-6`'s "grow `CatalogEntity` a `RecordFacet`"
  arm therefore reverses a decision this project made deliberately and left a
  guard behind. That is not fatal, but the arm must argue against SL-222 rather
  than treat the field as merely absent.
- **`facet` is already taken.** `src/facet.rs` `EntityFacets { risk, tags }` is a
  shared projection over *authored* entity facets, consumed by `format_show` and
  the priority graph — a different thing from `knowledge::RecordFacet`. Any new
  type or flag naming must not collide (STD-002; naming matters more than usual
  here).
- **Per-record-kind field lists are a known scatter hazard.** `kinds::RECORD` is
  the canonical const but ~17 sites hardcode the prefix literals
  (`mem.pattern.doctrine.record-kind-touch-sites`, high severity). `OQ-2`'s
  answer is exactly such a list — under STD-001 it must be one named constant
  keyed off `kinds::RECORD`, not match arms at the render site.

### Carried assumptions

- **A2** — the `facets` level's per-kind field lists are a *display* concern,
  not governance. `SPEC-019` declares no tiering, so SL-246 is the authority of
  first impression (research thread 1, ✓). If that is wrong the whole dial needs
  a `REV` first.
- **A3** — the `SPEC-019` four-of-seven gap (`ISS-316`) stays *outside* this
  slice. The design labels any `EVD`/`HYP`/`CPT` field list as invention rather
  than deriving it.
