# Notes SL-241: Capsule spike rig

Durable per-slice scratchpad — tracked in git. The place to lift anything from a
disposable phase sheet (`.doctrine/state/.../phase-NN.md`) that must survive
`rm -rf` before the slice close-out audit harvests it.

## Forward compatibility

- **RFC-023 (executable plan gates / adversarial TDD)** — substantial revisions
  to plan gates are expected. Operator ruling 2026-08-01: adopt current plan
  machinery as-is for this slice; expect heavy revision to follow. Nothing in
  the four-stage capsule pipeline (CON-004, DEC-104) depends on plan-gate
  mechanics, so the revisions should land orthogonally to this rig.
