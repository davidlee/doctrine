# Notes SL-241: Capsule spike rig

Durable per-slice scratchpad — tracked in git. The place to lift anything from a
disposable phase sheet (`.doctrine/state/.../phase-NN.md`) that must survive
`rm -rf` before the slice close-out audit harvests it.

fresh-as-of: 2026-08-01 · plan locked, PHASE-01 sheet expanded · 2626072e

### Produced

- design.md written, internally reviewed, externally inquisited — no code yet
  (commits 9d0c852f, 3966256a, eedc26b8, 7fd55d0f)
- RV-323 — 14 findings, all disposed `fix-now`; **all 14 terminal, review done**
- minted: QUE-202 — capsule-model conflict admission path
- amended both tiers: DEC-099 (Amendment 2 + facet), QUE-201, ASM-007
- IDE-009 — third lint canary appended (wholly-empty `[facet]`)
- plan.toml + plan.md — six phases, build/evidence split (4b495982, 2216769f,
  cbce7876, 2dc35d4d); six runtime sheets materialised (2f521a25)
- lifecycle: proposed → design → plan → ready (2626072e); `ready` is ADR-009's
  approved-plan gate, taken on operator approval
- `.gitignore` added as a design-target selector (design § 9.1)
- PHASE-01 runtime sheet expanded — 9 tasks, gitignored, not a durable artifact
- gate: no `src/` change this unit; `doctrine validate` clean at each commit

### Learned

- mem.pattern.doctrine.amend-knowledge-both-tiers
- mem.pattern.doctrine.repair-overshoots-the-named-axis
- mem.pattern.doctrine.path-policy-shell-hardening (raiser-side, 3afa085e)
- CPT-001 — five numbered classes, one with a git-level sub-class
- **environment**: `nix` and `direnv` are ABSENT in the jail (`/nix/store`,
  `bwrap`, `node`, `npm`, `claude` present); `$HOME` writable, `~/capsules/`
  creatable with no new mount. Pinned as PHASE-02 EX-8 / PHASE-04 EX-4.
- **R2 decomposes into two questions**, not one — `worktree import` has two
  scope postures and `conformance --strict` covers only the selector predicate
  (PHASE-01 sheet § T7; rides
  mem.pattern.dispatch.import-scope-belt-omit-slice-for-coupled-paths)
- **the step-0 contamination guard is two-sided** — design § 5.4 protects step 0
  from CPT-001; authoring the light fixture's `interpret:` list is itself a
  trigger enumeration, so PHASE-01 EX-12 + PHASE-04 EX-9 protect the other side.
  Not in the design because the design does not schedule the work.

### Open

- QUE-200 — ingestion mechanism M-A vs M-B; the rig's whole point
- QUE-201 — declaration home; now ergonomics-only, gains a probe-evidence input
- QUE-202 — how the capsule model *admits* the second result; refusal proven,
  admission not designed
- ASM-007 — exhaustiveness carried, confidence low; falsified only by § 5.4
  step 0's independent enumeration, never by fixture rows
- CON-004 — landed state append-only · CON-005 — threat-model fence
- DEC-099/101/102/103/104 — settled, carried
- OQ-1 — evidence-log storage tier; v0 ruling in slice § Risks
- R2 — open, and PHASE-01 T7 is what settles it. A genuine divergence is a
  `/consult`, never a `src/` change (slice non-goal)
- no `research.md` exists — the pre-design research round was never run; the
  drift advisory reports an absent artifact, deliberately not restamped
  (rationale in plan.md § Notes)

## Forward compatibility

- **RFC-023 (executable plan gates / adversarial TDD)** — substantial revisions
  to plan gates are expected. Operator ruling 2026-08-01: adopt current plan
  machinery as-is for this slice; expect heavy revision to follow. Nothing in
  the four-stage capsule pipeline (CON-004, DEC-104) depends on plan-gate
  mechanics, so the revisions should land orthogonally to this rig.
