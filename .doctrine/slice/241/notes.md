# Notes SL-241: Capsule spike rig

Durable per-slice scratchpad — tracked in git. The place to lift anything from a
disposable phase sheet (`.doctrine/state/.../phase-NN.md`) that must survive
`rm -rf` before the slice close-out audit harvests it.

fresh-as-of: 2026-08-01 · design (RV-323 round 2 close) · 56a76666

### Produced

- design.md written, internally reviewed, externally inquisited — no code yet
  (commits 9d0c852f, 3966256a, eedc26b8, 7fd55d0f)
- RV-323 — 14 findings, all disposed `fix-now`; F-1..F-13 verified, F-14 open
- minted: QUE-202 — capsule-model conflict admission path
- amended both tiers: DEC-099 (Amendment 2 + facet), QUE-201, ASM-007
- IDE-009 — third lint canary appended (wholly-empty `[facet]`)
- gate: no `src/` change this unit; `doctrine validate` clean, `memory validate`
  clean on both new memories. `.doctrine` changes committed per commit.

### Learned

- mem.pattern.doctrine.amend-knowledge-both-tiers
- mem.pattern.doctrine.repair-overshoots-the-named-axis
- mem.pattern.doctrine.path-policy-shell-hardening (raiser-side, 3afa085e)
- CPT-001 — five numbered classes, one with a git-level sub-class

### Open

- QUE-200 — ingestion mechanism M-A vs M-B; the rig's whole point
- QUE-201 — declaration home; now ergonomics-only, gains a probe-evidence input
- QUE-202 — how the capsule model *admits* the second result; refusal proven,
  admission not designed
- ASM-007 — exhaustiveness carried, confidence low; falsified only by § 5.4
  step 0's independent enumeration, never by fixture rows
- CON-004 — landed state append-only · CON-005 — threat-model fence
- DEC-099/101/102/103/104 — settled, carried
- OQ-1 — evidence-log storage tier; v0 ruling in slice § Risks
- RV-323 F-14 — awaiting raiser
- SL-241 status `proposed`; lifecycle flip to `design` not yet taken

## Forward compatibility

- **RFC-023 (executable plan gates / adversarial TDD)** — substantial revisions
  to plan gates are expected. Operator ruling 2026-08-01: adopt current plan
  machinery as-is for this slice; expect heavy revision to follow. Nothing in
  the four-stage capsule pipeline (CON-004, DEC-104) depends on plan-gate
  mechanics, so the revisions should land orthogonally to this rig.
