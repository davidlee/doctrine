# Notes SL-244: Gate conditions carry their own contract

Durable per-slice scratchpad — tracked in git. The place to lift anything from a
disposable phase sheet (`.doctrine/state/.../phase-NN.md`) that must survive
`rm -rf` before the slice close-out audit harvests it.

## Design surface triage
<!-- exploring/explore.triage, 2026-08-03. Detail lives in slice-244.md (scope,
     OQ-1..OQ-8) and research/research.md (threads, deltas). This is the ordering
     judgement over them, not a restatement. -->

**Constraining governance** — `DEC-101` (open→closed narrowing is a type error;
constrains satisfaction *sourcing* only), `DEC-102` (seal when an override would
make content false), `DEC-066`/`DEC-067` (evidence liveness, cumulative
revalidation), `STD-001`, `SPEC-029` (owns the gate table and describes evidence
as payload-claimed — the certain revision candidate), `ADR-001` (layering).
Checked not-applicable with reasons: research.md § Thread 1.

**The one structural fact the design turns on.** `Condition` is payload-free, and
that has already cost the codebase a refusal variant: `RunbookNotDischarged`
exists because `GateNotCleared`'s `Vec<Condition>` has *"nowhere for a step
identity to ride"* (`refusal.rs:166-170`). The premise is in-tree and argued by
the incumbent, not asserted by this slice.

**Shaping decisions, in the order they unlock each other.**

1. **What the engine should check** (`OQ-2`/`OQ-3`). Everything else is
   downstream. Research finding 1 established that the seal/craft line, the
   derived/claimed line, and `ISS-285`'s fork are all restatements of *does the
   engine check this?* — so `OQ-6` sequences nothing and must be dropped as a
   simplifier.
2. **Where the contract lives** (`OQ-1`/`OQ-4`) — Rust-side data vs prose
   correspondence. Now decidable on cost: prose needs no enum change but inherits
   `IMP-372` the moment overridability is claimed; Rust data has the
   `boundary_conditions` precedent but costs `Condition` its fieldless
   `Copy`/`Ord`/serde shape at every match site.
3. **Which channel carries it** (`OQ-7`) — splits by channel, not content. The
   refusal has no byte budget; the envelope has a hard one with `clearances`
   already riding it uncapped; the `Fragment` receipt is a third, amortised
   register (`commands/design.rs:1832-1851`).
4. **Subject rule** (`OQ-5`, `ISS-286`) — plausibly separable, and entangled with
   three inconsistent fixture conventions across four e2e suites.

**Risks carried into the design.** Snapshot versioning costs the one live run
(SL-243's, gitignored tier). Envelope byte budget. Three prose systems already
have three loaders — a fourth needs an argument. `is_derived()` asymmetry is
`IMP-361`'s known deferred gap, not a discovery. CHR-049 is one moderated run:
adequate to inform `ISS-285`'s deferred choice, not to settle it alone.

**Assumption.** `DEC-102`'s override seam does not exist; the available move is
embedded-and-`fixed`-with-a-citation, the pattern runbooks already use.

**Applied practice.** `mem.pattern.design.classify-at-authoring-not-from-behaviour`
(state the property in the artefact, don't infer it from a run) and
`mem_019faca1f05277729cb407f8d4487206` (ratify the incumbent before specifying a
format — here the kebab token, load-bearing four ways, and the two prose stores).
