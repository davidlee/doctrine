# Notes SL-244: Gate conditions carry their own contract

Durable per-slice scratchpad — tracked in git. The place to lift anything from a
disposable phase sheet (`.doctrine/state/.../phase-NN.md`) that must survive
`rm -rf` before the slice close-out audit harvests it.

## Design surface triage
<!-- exploring/explore.triage, 2026-08-03. Detail lives in slice-244.md (scope,
     OQ-1..OQ-8) and research/research.md (threads, deltas). This is the ordering
     judgement over them, not a restatement. -->

**Constraining governance** — `DEC-101` (open→closed narrowing is a type error;
constrains satisfaction *sourcing* only), `DEC-102` (seal when an override would
make content false), `DEC-066`/`DEC-067` (evidence liveness, cumulative
revalidation), `STD-001`, `SPEC-029` (owns the gate table and describes evidence
as payload-claimed — the certain revision candidate), `ADR-001` (layering).
Checked not-applicable with reasons: research.md § Thread 1.

**The one structural fact the design turns on.** `Condition` is payload-free, and
that has already cost the codebase a refusal variant: `RunbookNotDischarged`
exists because `GateNotCleared`'s `Vec<Condition>` has *"nowhere for a step
identity to ride"* (`refusal.rs:166-170`). The premise is in-tree and argued by
the incumbent, not asserted by this slice.

**Shaping decisions, in the order they unlock each other.**

1. **What the engine should check** (`OQ-2`/`OQ-3`). Everything else is
   downstream. Research finding 1 established that the seal/craft line, the
   derived/claimed line, and `ISS-285`'s fork are all restatements of *does the
   engine check this?* — so `OQ-6` sequences nothing and must be dropped as a
   simplifier.
2. **Where the contract lives** (`OQ-1`/`OQ-4`) — Rust-side data vs prose
   correspondence. Now decidable on cost: prose needs no enum change but inherits
   `IMP-372` the moment overridability is claimed; Rust data has the
   `boundary_conditions` precedent but costs `Condition` its fieldless
   `Copy`/`Ord`/serde shape at every match site.
3. **Which channel carries it** (`OQ-7`) — splits by channel, not content. The
   refusal has no byte budget; the envelope has a hard one with `clearances`
   already riding it uncapped; the `Fragment` receipt is a third, amortised
   register (`commands/design.rs:1832-1851`).
4. **Subject rule** (`OQ-5`, `ISS-286`) — plausibly separable, and entangled with
   three inconsistent fixture conventions across four e2e suites.

**Risks carried into the design.** Snapshot versioning costs the one live run
(SL-243's, gitignored tier). Envelope byte budget. Three prose systems already
have three loaders — a fourth needs an argument. `is_derived()` asymmetry is
`IMP-361`'s known deferred gap, not a discovery. CHR-049 is one moderated run:
adequate to inform `ISS-285`'s deferred choice, not to settle it alone.

**Assumption.** `DEC-102`'s override seam does not exist; the available move is
embedded-and-`fixed`-with-a-citation, the pattern runbooks already use.

**Applied practice.** `mem.pattern.design.classify-at-authoring-not-from-behaviour`
(state the property in the artefact, don't infer it from a run) and
`mem_019faca1f05277729cb407f8d4487206` (ratify the incumbent before specifying a
format — here the kebab token, load-bearing four ways, and the two prose stores).

## Exploring closed — handover state (2026-08-03)

Run `dr-019fc4dd-e049-7db0-8cea-9af8ff970810`, revision 25, stage `exploring`.
**All 13 inquiry nodes resolved, 0 open; the exploring runbook is discharged.**
Re-enter with `doctrine design resume 244` — the graph, the dispositions and the
linked records come back with it. This section holds only what the run cannot
carry.

**Seven decisions, in dependency order.** `DEC-120` (kinds: derived / attested /
claimed, plus the 2026-08-03 sharpening that Attested names *input provenance*,
not a second way of deciding) → `DEC-121` (the exploring pair becomes attested
user checkpoints) → `DEC-122` (contracts ship as embedded prose, `fixed`) →
`DEC-123` (structure rides a const table, prose stays narrative) → `DEC-124`
(refusal carries the remedy, stage-entry receipt carries the contract, no digest)
→ `DEC-125` (findings unify on `RV` with a section reference) → `DEC-126` (what
the gate should check — the classification, and the answer to the slice's root
question).

**Spawned, all with contracts already written:** `IMP-391` (build the
exploring-stage checkpoints), `IMP-392` (the `RV` finding migration), `IDE-047`
(structure extracted from contract prose).

**The one thing a drafting agent must not re-litigate.** `DEC-126` is specified
against the `RV`-backed finding model, not the runtime `Finding`. Writing
contracts against a record `DEC-125` deletes is the mistake `DEC-121` caught on
the other edge.

**Where the design will be hardest** (`DEC-125`): a section's fingerprint moves,
`DEC-066` invalidation is snapshot-internal, and `RV` has no fingerprint concept.
The `design materialise` authored-watermark pattern is the shape to follow.

**Interim states this slice knowingly ships**, both stated rather than accidental:
`exploring → inquiring` passes on the runbook alone until `IMP-391`; the
`Conducted { review }` arm and the severity summary are unbuildable until
`IMP-392`.

**Still owed by the slice:** objective 6 — spec-adjacent documentation with
canonical interaction diagrams. Two things belong in it that appear in no shipped
guidance and that an agent currently discovers by being refused: that a productive
integrated pass invalidates its own clearance under whole-map currency, and that
review nevertheless terminates when the user declines another round
(`RFC-026` E3), so staleness informs that decision rather than barring it.

**Correction carried forward:** an earlier turn claimed the missing
promotion leg was captured as `ISS-303`. It was not — nothing was created, and
`ISS-303` is an unrelated existing issue. `DEC-125` supersedes that framing
entirely (unification dissolves the promotion leg), so nothing is outstanding.
