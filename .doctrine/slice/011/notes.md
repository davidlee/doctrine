# Notes SL-011: Cache-friendly session boot context

Durable per-slice scratchpad — tracked in git. The place to lift anything from a
disposable phase sheet (`.doctrine/state/.../phase-NN.md`) that must survive
`rm -rf` before the slice close-out audit harvests it.

## Mechanism (what shipped)

`src/boot.rs` — the cache-friendly governance snapshot. A pure assembler
(`boot_sequence` + `render_boot`) projects stable governance into the agent's
cached session-start prefix; a thin impure shell (`produce`, `write_if_changed`,
`run`, `wire`/`run_install`) gathers section bodies, resolves `current_exe()`,
and writes only on content change (the content-diff cache key). Verbs:

- `doctrine boot` — regenerate `.doctrine/state/boot.md` (the hook target).
- `doctrine boot install` — wire the `@`-import + per-harness SessionStart hook.
- `doctrine boot --check` — DISK sentry: stale (≠ recompute) / unpopulated.

Harness seam is `enum Harness {Claude, Codex}` + `match` (NOT trait/Box<dyn> —
D8/Charge IV; mirrors `skills.rs`). Identity-unification with `skills::Agent` is
deferred debt until SL-012 frees `skills.rs` (the §3 concurrency gate).

## Durable findings (harvested from phase sheets 04 + 05)

- **`--check` is a DISK sentry, never a session sentry** (codex F2 / design §5.4).
  It sees the *file* fresh while the *current inlined prefix* stays stale until
  `/clear`/restart. CLI wording is disk-scoped on purpose; in-session freshness is
  `/route`'s ≤2-session lag warning + the `/canon` freshen-now ritual (regenerate
  THEN `/clear`), never an `--check` claim.
- **`boot_check` is deterministic — no clock, no in-content timestamp.** A
  generation timestamp baked into the snapshot would bust the cache every session
  and defeat §1, so freshness is reported out-of-band only. One render path:
  `build_sections` is shared by `regenerate` and `boot_check` (no second fork).
- **Clippy gate footgun.** `just check` runs plain `cargo clippy` (bins/lib only).
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` lights up ~800 `unwrap_used`/`expect_used` denials
  in TEST code (the workspace restriction lints apply to test targets too). Mirror
  the gate, not `--all-targets`. Captured in AGENTS.md conventions.
- **`--check` flag can't `conflicts_with` the `install` subcommand** — clap
  subcommands aren't a conflictable arg group. Dropped the attribute; dispatch
  precedence (`Some(Install)` wins, else `None if check`) makes `--check` a no-op
  when `install` is present (documented in the arg help).
- **Ownership match is dep-free `rsplit`, not shell-split** (PHASE-04, A4). Hook
  command is always `<program> boot` — split on the *last* whitespace keeps a
  spaced program path whole, zero dep. FOOTGUN: a second/spaced hook arg breaks
  it → switch to a real shell-word split (shell-words crate). Guarded by a NOTE on
  `is_doctrine_boot_command` + the spaced-path test.
- **JSON merge does not enable serde_json `preserve_order`** — the Value
  round-trip preserves every foreign key/hook (tested) but re-sorts object keys
  alphabetically. Acceptable: `settings.local.json` is gitignored/regenerable.
- **Symlink dedup writes through to the real inode.** `resolve_target` =
  `canonicalize`-or-original; the `CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md` case writes the resolved
  `AGENTS.md` (one inode, one write) and the symlink survives — never `rename`d
  over (which would split the inode).
- **Integration tests exercise `wire`/`regenerate`/`boot_check`, not the
  `current_exe()` shells.** Under `cargo test`, `current_exe()` is
  `doctrine-<hash>`, rejected by the ownership match — so inject a fake exec and
  test the inner fn, never through `run_install`/`run`.

## Closure gate (POST-BUILD, USER-RUN)

The build self-installs and dogfoods clean (`boot install` wired this repo's
`@`-import + hook; `boot` regenerates; `boot --check` reports in-sync, only the
genuinely-empty `Accepted ADRs` unpopulated). Two confirmations remain that only
a live harness can give — recorded here as the closure verification:

1. **The live ordeal.** A real Claude session must witness (a) the
   `startup|clear` SessionStart matcher firing the hook, and (b) the ≤2-session
   in-session lag (an edit to governance becomes visible only after the
   freshen-now ritual or ≤2 session-starts). The matcher token is asserted by the
   research doc and `clear`-fires-SessionStart is already witnessed; the OR-token
   string itself wants live confirmation.
2. **The live codex run.** Confirm codex inlines the `AGENTS.md` `@`-import into
   its system prompt (no SessionStart equivalent → unbounded staleness if it does
   not) and honours the routing.

## Closure finding — jailed-dev hook path (live ordeal, 2026-06-05)

The live ordeal CONFIRMED the `startup` SessionStart matcher fires the hook
(half the ordeal passes). It also surfaced a real gap:

- **`current_exe()` is jail-internal; the harness runs hooks on the host.** The
  agent runs inside a bubblewrap jail (`/workspace/doctrine`); Claude Code runs
  the SessionStart hook *outside* the jail, where that mount does not exist →
  `/workspace/doctrine/target/debug/doctrine: No such file or directory`
  (non-blocking — the session continued, the snapshot just did not auto-refresh).
- The `@`-import is RELATIVE (`@.doctrine/state/boot.md`) so it resolves fine
  regardless — only the absolute hook command breaks. The hook is the only
  host-context invocation, so it is the only thing exposed to the mismatch.
- **Root cause = design R1 (`current_exe()`) under a jail.** §5.3 R1 anticipated
  dev/installed/nix-store path volatility but NOT a mount-namespace split where
  the path resolver (in-jail agent) and the hook runner (host harness) see
  different roots. `boot install` has **no `--exec` override**, so run from inside
  the jail it can only ever bake the jail-internal path.
- **The hook fires in BOTH contexts (host AND jail)** — confirmed live. The bare
  hook fired on the HOST and succeeded (regenerated the snapshot with
  `current_exe()` = `/home/david/.cargo/bin/doctrine`). A jailed firing resolves
  a different binary/path.
- **THRASH — two shapes, one root (snapshot must be byte-identical per regen).**
  (a) *Path-string skew* (the dev-build symptom first seen): a jail regen via
  `./target/debug/doctrine` bakes `/workspace/doctrine/target/debug/doctrine`
  into `Invoking doctrine` while a host regen bakes `/home/david/.cargo/bin/
  doctrine` → the line flips per firing context → perpetual `stale` + cache-tail
  bust. (b) *Version skew* (the deeper one, given the jail isolates its own home):
  the jail's `persist-home "agent"` already rw-binds an isolated, writable,
  persistent home at in-jail `/home/david` (`.cargo` included) — so the path
  STRING can be identical in both contexts yet resolve to a DIFFERENT physical
  binary (host real install vs agent-store install). Same string keeps the
  `Invoking` line stable, but two installs at different versions render different
  snapshot CONTENT → thrash. Two installs = two currency points = the real cost.
- **RESOLUTION (operator, jail flake — LANDED): share one host binary, ro-bind on
  top of the persisted copy.** `persist-home` already gives the jail its isolated
  `/home/david` — no separate `.cargo` mount needed. `extraOptions` applies AFTER
  `persist-home`, so ro-binding the host binary over the persisted path wins:
  ```nix
  (try-readonly (noescape "~/.cargo/bin/doctrine"))  # ro-bind host doctrine OVER persisted copy
  (add-path "/home/david/.cargo/bin")                # bare `doctrine boot` resolves in jail
  ```
  One physical binary, one currency point (host `cargo install --path .`).
  `--ro-bind-try` → the jail still launches if the binary is unbuilt. Bare
  `doctrine boot` (hook, already set) resolves; satisfies the ownership match
  (program token `doctrine`, last arg `boot`). (Rejected stopgap: in-jail
  `/bin/doctrine` → `target/debug/doctrine` — bakes the divergent `/workspace`
  path, CAUSES path-skew thrash; removed.)
- **§5.3 bare-emit follow-up → LOW priority now.** With the ro-bind, in-jail
  `current_exe()` = `/home/david/.cargo/bin/doctrine` = the host string, so even
  the current `boot install` (bakes `current_exe()`, no bare-emit branch yet) is
  stable across host/jail. The §5.3 R1 "on PATH → emit bare `doctrine`" branch
  still UNIMPLEMENTED, but now only matters for the dev-build case (`boot install`
  run from `./target/debug`). Deferred follow-up, not blocking.

## Codex closure finding — @-import dead, SessionStart-emit is the path (2026-06-05)

Live codex run (codex-cli 0.133.0, `gpt-5.4`) settled the §6 open question.

- **Codex reads AGENTS.md but does NOT expand the `@`-import.** Verified with
  `codex debug prompt-input` (renders the exact model-visible prompt, no model
  call): `bootstrap doctrine`, `known CLI gaps`, the literal `@.doctrine/state/
  boot.md` line — all FOUND; the snapshot BODY (`Route before you act`,
  `Doctrine Boot Context`) — ABSENT. Codex sees the `@`-line as plain text. So
  `boot install`'s codex arm (import-only, design D8/§5.2) is **known-broken**:
  governance never reaches codex.
- **BUT codex 0.133.0 has a hook system with a `SessionStart` event whose stdout
  is injected as developer context** (`developers.openai.com/codex/hooks`,
  captured in `scratch/codex/`). Matcher applies to `source`
  (`startup|resume|clear|compact`). "Plain text on stdout is added as extra
  developer context" (or JSON `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`). The design
  premise "codex has no SessionStart equivalent" (§5.4/§6) is STALE.
- **The real codex path (supersedes both import-only AND the cut fallback):** a
  codex `SessionStart` hook that runs `doctrine boot` (regenerate) then EMITS the
  snapshot on stdout → codex inlines it as developer context. This solves refresh
  AND injection in one hook, and is BETTER than the Claude path: codex injects
  into the CURRENT session → **zero lag** (vs Claude's ≤2-session `@`-import lag).
- **SPIKE CONFIRMED (2026-06-05).** `.codex/hooks.json` SessionStart →
  `sh -c 'doctrine boot >/dev/null 2>&1; cat "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/
  .doctrine/state/boot.md"'` injects the snapshot body as developer context —
  verified live (codex saw "Route before you act"). GOTCHA: project-local hooks
  load ONLY when the `.codex/` LAYER is trusted — that is SEPARATE from per-hook
  trust; `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` bypasses the latter, NOT the former.
  First spike (untrusted project layer) didn't load the hook; granting project
  trust made it work. The follow-up slice must handle project-layer trust (or
  user/managed scope).
- **Cost: it's a design change + new code, NOT PHASE-06.** The `Harness::Codex`
  arm must write a `.codex/hooks.json` (or `[hooks]` in config.toml) SessionStart
  entry instead of the `@`-import; likely a small `doctrine boot --emit`
  (regenerate-and-print-to-stdout) verb so the hook is one clean call rather than
  `doctrine boot >/dev/null; cat boot.md`. Trust: non-managed codex hooks need
  `/hooks` review (hash-pinned) or a managed `requirements.toml` source.
- **DISPOSITION:** for SL-011 v1, codex is **cut** (Claude-only `import_targets`;
  the `Harness::Codex` arm stays the staged seam) — but the cut is now a DEFERRAL
  to a scoped follow-up slice ("codex SessionStart-emit wiring") with the
  mechanism above, NOT an open question. Claude (import + refresh hook) is the
  supported v1 harness. This finding should also revise design §5.4/§6 (open
  question resolved) when that slice is shaped.
