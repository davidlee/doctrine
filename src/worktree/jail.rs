//! Pure jail core — SL-182 PHASE-02 (leaf tier, ADR-001).
//!
//! **INTERFACE SKELETON (PHASE-02 T0).** Signatures + types + doc-contracts only;
//! every body is `unimplemented!()`. This exists to be adversarially reviewed
//! (codex, purity/coupling/cohesion/SL-183-seam) BEFORE any TDD behaviour is sunk.
//! Bodies are filled in T1..T8 red/green/refactor. Behavioural reference: the
//! harvested probe scripts at `.doctrine/slice/182/probe-evidence/scripts/`.
//!
//! ## Purity contract (leaf, ADR-001 — no clock/git/disk/rng)
//! This module is classified `"worktree::jail" = "leaf"`. `worktree::shared`
//! (which owns `is_linked_worktree`, a git read) is **engine** — a leaf cannot
//! import engine, so the git-topology recognition CANNOT live here. The layering
//! gate enforces the pure/imperative split: the PHASE-03 shell (`pretooluse.rs`,
//! command tier) performs the git-topology check + the policy disk read + the host
//! capability probe + **all path canonicalization**, and passes the *resolved*
//! answers in as data:
//!   - `cwd_is_project_worktree: bool`  (was `worktrees_root` in design §5.2 — see R1)
//!   - `JailPolicy`                     (parsed from the ro policy file by the shell)
//!   - `Backend`                        (capability-as-data descriptor, RV-202)
//!   - **canonical paths**             (see D-canon below)
//!
//! ## D-canon — the canonicalization cut (twin of R1, MF-1/MF-2)
//! `realpath` resolves symlinks against the live filesystem — a **disk read**, so it
//! cannot live in this leaf, exactly as the git-topology read cannot (R1). Every path
//! the pure surface compares MUST arrive already **symlink-resolved and absolute**,
//! canonicalized by the shell with `realpath -m` semantics (non-existent-safe — a
//! write target or `extra_rw` entry need not exist yet), matching the proven probe
//! (`pretooluse-pathcheck.sh`: relative→`cwd`-join, then `realpath -m` on both `real`
//! and `wt`). This is **security-load-bearing**: without it a symlinked / `..`-bearing
//! / relative `file_path` or `extra_rw` bypasses the INV-2 (repo-root) / INV-3 (`.git`)
//! / INV-4 (allowlist) walls. The leaf therefore does PURE component-wise prefix /
//! ancestor tests (`Path::starts_with`, NOT string prefix — the sibling-prefix guard
//! the probe spelled with a trailing slash: `/wt` must not match `/wt-evil`). The
//! *contract* is locked here in T0; the canonicalization *impl* is the PHASE-03/04
//! shell's, tested at that boundary. (`decide_write`'s param is `real`, not the raw
//! stdin `file_path`, to make the precondition load-bearing at the type site.)
//!
//! ## Open interface decisions for the codex pass (recorded in the phase sheet)
//! - **R1 / D-resolve-purity.** `resolve_target` takes `cwd_is_project_worktree: bool`
//!   (shell-resolved) rather than computing topology from a `worktrees_root` prefix.
//!   This *diverges from the literal design §5.2 signature* — deliberately: the design
//!   also mandates git-topology-not-path-prefix (A1), and a path-prefix `worktrees_root`
//!   is exactly what A1 rejects. Confirm this is the right cut.
//! - **Seatbelt stub.** `select_jailer` must return `Some` for `Backend::Seatbelt`
//!   (VT-8), so a `Seatbelt` unit struct exists here with a `wrap_argv` that
//!   `unimplemented!()`s ("SL-183"). Is a stub struct the right way to keep the seam
//!   real today, or should VT-8 assert on the descriptor without a struct?
//! - **Error type.** `validate_policy` / `JailPolicy::from_toml_str` return
//!   `Result<_, String>`. Stringly-typed — sufficient, or a typed error enum?
//! - **base64.** `opaque_wrap` needs base64 encoding (T6). Add the `base64` external
//!   crate (leaf may import external, cf. `worktree::allowlist` imports `glob`), or
//!   hand-roll? Deferred to T6; irrelevant to the skeleton.
//! - **Dispatch shape.** `select_jailer -> Option<Box<dyn Jailer>>` (trait object) vs
//!   matching `Backend` inline. Design says trait (D8 single fork point); confirm the
//!   trait-object indirection earns its keep for a 3-variant enum.

// PHASE-02 skeleton: the pure surface is unconsumed until the PHASE-03 shell and the
// T2+ tests land. Held here (not on the `mod` decl) so it covers both `test` and
// `not(test)` cfg while items are dead; self-clears (unfulfilled → fires) once every
// item has a consumer, forcing removal (mem.pattern.lint.module-decl-expect-propagates).
